## Description
<p>It is important for networks to convert social capital through the exchange and pooling of value among the members</p>

<p>This can best be achieved through new innovations like blockchain that allows peer to peer transfers of value, transparency of transactions and fragmentation of assets to micro units.</p>

<p>In this backdrop we are working towards a stablecoin for savings credit and investments dubbed YENTS - Young Entrepreneurs Network Tokens.</p>
